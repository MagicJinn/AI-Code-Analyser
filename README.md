# AI Code Analyser

This repo scans code files in the `Code` folder, sends them to a local AI model for performance grading, and sorts them into folders by severity (Severe, Important, Medium, Minimal).

**Note:** The analysis is not super accurate and the script was quickly/lazily coded. Use at your own risk!
